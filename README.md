# Databases


## Postgres Clients for JavaScript
- [node-postgres](https://node-postgres.com/)
- [postgres](https://github.com/porsager/postgres)
- [sequelize](https://github.com/sequelize/sequelize)
- [Objection.js - An SQL-friendly ORM for Node.js](https://vincit.github.io/objection.js/)
- [typeorm](https://github.com/typeorm/typeorm)

These are just easy to grab a list of files and load into postgres. There is a COPY command executed via CLI/bash to which can be used and this is used for BULK loads by Data Analysts/Engineers. But that is often wrapped in a Python moduleÂ called "subprocess" or "os" which executes it as a bash command. I'm not as familiar with using JS (e.g. Node?) for API development, but I imagine whichever ORM you find is best for API development would be the best tool to load data into the Postgres database.
